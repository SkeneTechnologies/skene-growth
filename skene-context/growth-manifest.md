## Growth Hubs

### Growth Loops Implementation Plan (plan command)

- **File**: `src/skene_growth/cli/main.py`
- **Intent**: Enable viral growth and drive user engagement by suggesting and implementing relevant growth loops within the codebase.
- **Confidence**: 90.0%
- **Entry Point**: `plan (Typer command)`- **Growth Potential**:
  - Add a 'growth loop preview' feature that showcases the selected loops to the user in a more visually appealing format before the plan is generated.
  - Implement a feedback mechanism allowing users to rate the quality and relevance of suggested loops, improving the LLM model's accuracy over time.
  - Develop a mechanism for the tool to automatically track the implementation of growth loops and measure their effectiveness, providing data-driven insights into growth initiatives.

### Growth Objectives Generator (objectives command)

- **File**: `src/skene_growth/cli/main.py`
- **Intent**: Drives user engagement by providing a structured way to set and track product-led growth goals.
- **Confidence**: 80.0%
- **Entry Point**: `objectives (Typer command)`- **Growth Potential**:
  - Implement a system for users to track the progress of their growth objectives directly within the tool, creating a feedback loop and enhancing user engagement.
  - Add integrations with popular analytics platforms to automatically update objective metrics, reducing manual effort and providing real-time performance insights.
  - Develop a feature that recommends specific actions or experiments to help users achieve their growth objectives based on the identified GTM gaps.

### Daily Logs

- **File**: `src/skene_growth/cli/main.py`
- **Intent**: Enables data-driven decisions by allowing the periodic (ideally daily) collection of key metrics
- **Confidence**: 70.0%
- **Entry Point**: `daily_logs (Typer command)`- **Growth Potential**:
  - Add automated scheduling of daily log fetching using system task schedulers to minimize user intervention.
  - Develop a dashboard to visualize trends in daily log data and provide automated insights and anomaly detection.
  - Implement alerting mechanisms to notify users when key metrics deviate significantly from defined targets or healthy benchmarks.

### Growth Template Generation

- **File**: `src/skene_growth/cli/main.py`
- **Intent**: Facilitates user onboarding by providing a structured framework for understanding product-led growth principles.
- **Confidence**: 70.0%
- **Entry Point**: `_write_growth_template (called internally)`- **Growth Potential**:
  - Create a library of pre-built growth templates tailored to different business models and industries to accelerate user onboarding.
  - Develop a visual editor for users to customize their growth templates, allowing them to add, remove, and modify lifecycle stages, milestones, and metrics.
  - Implement a feature that recommends relevant growth loops based on the selected growth template, providing a guided path for implementation.


## GTM Gaps

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| User Onboarding Tutorial | A guided tutorial for new users to understand the tool's functionality and how to get started. | high |
| Usage Analytics | Track user behavior within the CLI tool (command usage, frequency, errors) to identify areas for improvement and optimization. | high |
| Community Forum/Support | A platform for users to ask questions, share knowledge, and provide feedback on the tool. This enhances user engagement and builds a community around the tool. | medium |
| Sharing Capabilities | Allow users to easily share growth plans or objectives with their team members or colleagues to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing. | low |
