# skene-growth

A command-line tool for product-led growth analysis and implementation.


## Tech Stack

skene-growth is built with:

- **Framework**: Typer
- **Language**: Python

## Features

### Growth Loops Implementation Plan (plan command)

Enable viral growth and drive user engagement by suggesting and implementing relevant growth loops within the codebase.

**Key capabilities:**
- Add a 'growth loop preview' feature that showcases the selected loops to the user in a more visually appealing format before the plan is generated.
- Implement a feedback mechanism allowing users to rate the quality and relevance of suggested loops, improving the LLM model's accuracy over time.
- Develop a mechanism for the tool to automatically track the implementation of growth loops and measure their effectiveness, providing data-driven insights into growth initiatives.

### Growth Objectives Generator (objectives command)

Drives user engagement by providing a structured way to set and track product-led growth goals.

**Key capabilities:**
- Implement a system for users to track the progress of their growth objectives directly within the tool, creating a feedback loop and enhancing user engagement.
- Add integrations with popular analytics platforms to automatically update objective metrics, reducing manual effort and providing real-time performance insights.
- Develop a feature that recommends specific actions or experiments to help users achieve their growth objectives based on the identified GTM gaps.

### Daily Logs

Enables data-driven decisions by allowing the periodic (ideally daily) collection of key metrics

**Key capabilities:**
- Add automated scheduling of daily log fetching using system task schedulers to minimize user intervention.
- Develop a dashboard to visualize trends in daily log data and provide automated insights and anomaly detection.
- Implement alerting mechanisms to notify users when key metrics deviate significantly from defined targets or healthy benchmarks.

### Growth Template Generation

Facilitates user onboarding by providing a structured framework for understanding product-led growth principles.

**Key capabilities:**
- Create a library of pre-built growth templates tailored to different business models and industries to accelerate user onboarding.
- Develop a visual editor for users to customize their growth templates, allowing them to add, remove, and modify lifecycle stages, milestones, and metrics.
- Implement a feature that recommends relevant growth loops based on the selected growth template, providing a guided path for implementation.


## Roadmap

We're working on the following improvements:

- **User Onboarding Tutorial**: A guided tutorial for new users to understand the tool's functionality and how to get started.
- **Usage Analytics**: Track user behavior within the CLI tool (command usage, frequency, errors) to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

- Community Forum/Support: A platform for users to ask questions, share knowledge, and provide feedback on the tool. This enhances user engagement and builds a community around the tool.
- Sharing Capabilities: Allow users to easily share growth plans or objectives with their team members or colleagues to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.
