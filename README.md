PLG (Product-Led Growth) codebase analysis toolkit. Scan your codebase, detect growth opportunities, and generate actionable implementation plans.

## Quick Start

```bash
uvx skene-growth config --init   # Create config file
uvx skene-growth config          # Set provider, model, API key
uvx skene-growth analyze .       # Analyze your codebase
uvx skene-growth plan            # Generate a growth plan
uvx skene-growth build           # Build an implementation prompt
```

## What It Does

- **Tech stack detection** -- identifies frameworks, databases, auth, deployment
- **Growth feature discovery** -- finds existing signup flows, sharing, invites, billing
- **Revenue leakage analysis** -- spots missing monetization and weak pricing tiers
- **Growth plan generation** -- produces prioritized growth loops with implementation roadmaps
- **Implementation prompts** -- builds ready-to-use prompts for Cursor, Claude, or other AI tools
- **Interactive chat** -- ask questions about your codebase in the terminal

Supports OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, LM Studio, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Free local audit available with no API key required.

## Installation

# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
