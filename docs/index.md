# skene-growth

A CLI toolkit for analyzing codebases through the lens of Product-Led Growth (PLG) — detecting growth features, revenue leakage, and generating actionable growth plans.

## What skene-growth does

- **Analyzes your codebase** to detect tech stack, growth features, and revenue leakage patterns
- **Generates a growth manifest** — structured JSON output documenting your product's growth surface area
- **Creates growth plans** — a Council of Growth Engineers produces 3-5 high-impact growth loops
- **Builds implementation prompts** that you can send directly to Cursor, Claude, or display in your terminal
- **Provides an MCP server** exposing 12 tools for AI assistants
- **Supports multiple LLM providers**: OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, LM Studio, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Core workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a config file
uvx skene-growth config --init

# 2. Set up your LLM provider and API key interactively
uvx skene-growth config

# 3. Analyze your codebase
uvx skene-growth analyze .

# 4. Generate a growth plan
uvx skene-growth plan

# 5. Build an implementation prompt
uvx skene-growth build
```

## Key concepts

**Growth manifest** (`growth-manifest.json`) — The primary output of the `analyze` command. A structured JSON file containing your project's tech stack, existing growth features, growth opportunities, and revenue leakage issues.

**Growth template** (`growth-template.json`) — A custom PLG template generated alongside the manifest, with lifecycle stages and metrics tailored to your business type.

**Growth plan** (`growth-plan.md`) — A markdown document produced by the `plan` command. Contains 3-5 selected high-impact growth loops with implementation roadmaps, metrics, and week-by-week timelines.

**Growth loops** — Individual loop definitions (JSON) generated by the `build` command. Each loop includes file/function requirements, integration points, telemetry specs, verification commands, and success metrics.
