---

Install backend Skills into your Supabase project. CRM, billing, helpdesk, project management, calendar, and more. Each Skill adds tables, enums, RLS policies, and seed data. Pick what you need.

```bash
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene
```

Skills install to your `.claude/skills/` directory. Your AI agent reads the SKILL.md files, understands the schema, and applies the migrations to your Supabase project. That's it -- the same data model that powers Salesforce, HubSpot, Jira, Zendesk, and Stripe. Except you own it.

---

## Why this exists

AI can build a frontend in minutes. Cursor, Claude Code, v0, Bolt -- they generate UI fast. But every project still starts with an empty Postgres instance and a blank migration file.

Every founder using AI to build a SaaS product hits the same wall in the first hour. What tables do I need? How do I handle multi-tenancy? What should my RLS look like?

These are solved problems. But everyone solves them alone, from scratch, every time.

### Skene Skills are the starting line

Composable backend capabilities you install and build on.

Every business app stores the same data. CRM, helpdesk, project management, billing -- 80% of the schema is identical. That 80% should not be custom work every time.

### Your AI agent gets a 2-week head start

An agent building on a well-defined, documented schema writes better code with fewer tokens than one guessing your data model. Less prompting, more building.

### Your data is becoming someone else's moat

In 2025, the platforms you pay to store your business data started locking it down. Salesforce changed its Slack API terms to prohibit bulk data export and explicitly block using data accessed via Slack APIs to train LLMs. Third-party AI tools that had been indexing Slack conversations to build internal copilots were cut off overnight.

Meta updated its WhatsApp Business terms to prohibit third-party AI providers from using the API if AI is their primary service, prompting the European Commission to open a formal antitrust investigation and Italy's antitrust authority to force Meta to suspend the restrictive terms.

The pattern is the same everywhere. You store data in a vendor's system. The vendor decides you can't use that data to train your own AI, feed it to a competitor's model, or even export it without restrictions. Your CRM data, your support tickets, your team conversations -- all behind someone else's API, subject to terms they can change whenever they want.

### You own the data

Skene Skills deploy directly into your Supabase Postgres instance. No per-seat pricing. No rate-limited APIs. No Zapier glue between tools. One database you control. When you want to train an AI on your customer data, query it from your own tables, or pipe it into whatever model you choose, nobody can change the terms on you. The data is yours because the database is yours.

---

## Quick start

### Install via skills.sh

```bash
# Install all Skene Skills
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene

# Or install specific skills
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene -s crm
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene -s billing
```

Skills install to `.claude/skills/` (or the equivalent directory for your AI agent). Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` with full schema documentation, example queries, and a `migration.sql` your agent applies to Supabase.

### Or apply migrations directly

No agent needed. Run the SQL files against your Supabase project:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f identity/migration.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f crm/migration.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f pipeline/migration.sql
```

### Load demo data (optional)

Each skill includes a `seed.sql` with realistic sample data:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f identity/seed.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f crm/seed.sql
```

Creates fictional data you can build against immediately -- contacts, companies, deals, tickets, billing, and activity records.

## See your customer journey

Install Skills, connect your Supabase project to [Skene Cloud](https://skene.ai), and the engine generates a visual journey map of your entire schema. It reads your enums and foreign keys, discovers every lifecycle, and maps them automatically. No configuration required.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/skene-engine-demo.gif" alt="Skene Engine generating a visual journey from your schema" width="720" />
</p>

| Lifecycle | Stages | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Contact | lead → prospect → customer → partner | `contact_type` enum |
| Deal | per-pipeline custom stages | `pipeline_stages` table |
| Ticket | open → pending → resolved → closed | `ticket_status` enum |
| Subscription | trialing → active → past_due → canceled | `subscription_status` enum |
| Task | todo → in_progress → in_review → done | `task_status` enum |
| Invoice | draft → open → paid → void | `invoice_status` enum |
| Document | draft → published → archived | `document_status` enum |

The AI compiler reads your enums and foreign keys, discovers these lifecycles, and maps them into a Time-to-Value journey — showing how users move from signup to value realization.

Cross-entity journeys connect the dots:

- **Lead-to-Revenue** — Contact created → first deal → deal won → subscription → first payment
- **Support-driven retention** — Ticket spike → subscription at risk → proactive outreach
- **Product-led growth** — User signup → feature adoption → team invite → upgrade

The schema is the source of truth. [See it live →](https://skene.ai)

## Built for AI agents

Skene Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` that any AI coding agent can read -- Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and others.

When you install via `npx skills add`, the SKILL.md files land in your agent's skills directory. Your agent gets full context: table schemas, column types, enums, RLS rules, and working SQL examples. No weeks of migration iteration.

The schema uses consistent patterns that AI agents understand immediately:

- Every table has the same base columns (`id`, `org_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `metadata`)
- Postgres enums define clear state machines (`deal_status`, `ticket_status`, `task_status`)
- `COMMENT ON` annotations explain every table and non-obvious column
- Each SKILL.md includes example queries an agent can reference
- Dependency declarations so an agent knows what to keep or drop

**Example prompts that work out of the box:**

> Build me a CRM dashboard with Next.js. I have Skene Skills installed -- use the contacts, companies, and pipeline tables.

> Create an API with Supabase Edge Functions for managing tickets. Include status transitions and SLA tracking.

> Build a billing admin panel that shows MRR, active subscriptions, and outstanding invoices.

> Add a customer portal where contacts can view their tickets, invoices, and upcoming events.

The SKILL.md gives the agent everything it needs: typed tables, clear relationships, sensible defaults, and enough structure to generate working code without ambiguity.

---

## What you can build

Mix and match Skills. Each combination is a product:

```
CRM            = identity + crm + pipeline + comms + analytics
Project tool   = identity + tasks + content + analytics
Helpdesk       = identity + crm + support + comms + knowledge + analytics
Billing app    = identity + crm + billing + commerce + analytics
Marketing      = identity + crm + campaigns + forms + analytics
Internal wiki  = identity + content + knowledge
Full business  = install all 19 skills
```

Every Skill is optional except Identity. Dependencies resolve automatically.

---

## Schema design principles

**Multi-tenant by default.** Every row belongs to an org. RLS enforces isolation automatically.

**Enums for state machines.** `deal_status`, `ticket_status`, `task_status`, `subscription_status` are all Postgres enums. They define the lifecycle of every entity.

**Polymorphic references.** Tables like `activities`, `comments`, `threads`, and `taggings` use `entity_type` + `entity_id` to reference any table. One activity log covers everything.

**JSONB escape hatch.** The `metadata` column on every table lets you store unstructured data without migrations. Use it for integrations, prototyping, or fields you haven't decided on yet.

**Stripe-ready.** Nullable `stripe_*` columns on billing tables. Wire them up when you integrate Stripe. Ignore them until then. Partial unique indexes prevent duplicate Stripe IDs.

**Immutable history.** `deal_stage_history` and `activities` are append-only audit logs. Pipeline analytics and compliance for free.

---

## Skene Cloud (optional upgrade)

Skene Skills is complete on its own. Build your app, query with SQL, extend however you want.

When you're ready for automation, [Skene Cloud](https://skene.ai) adds a journey engine on top. It watches your Skene Skills tables for changes and triggers actions automatically. No code changes required.

### How it works

```
+-----------+       +-------------------+       +------------------+
|  Your App |       |  Skene Skills     |       |   Skene Cloud    |
|           | ----> |  (your Supabase)  | ----> |   (skene.ai)     |
|  Frontend |       |                   |       |                  |
+-----------+       |  INSERT/UPDATE    |       |  Journey Engine  |
                    |  on any table     |       |  State Machine   |
                    |       |           |       |  Action Dispatch |
                    |       v           |       |       |          |
                    |  skene_growth     |       |       v          |
                    |  .event_log       | ----> |  Email, Webhook  |
                    |  (pg_net webhook) |       |  Analytics, etc  |
                    +-------------------+       +------------------+
```

**1. Connect your Supabase project** to Skene Cloud. The engine introspects your schema and discovers all Skene Skills tables, columns, foreign keys, and enums automatically.

**2. The AI compiler maps your schema to lifecycles.** It reads your enums (`deal_status`, `ticket_status`, `contact_type`, `subscription_status`) and generates lifecycle definitions with stages, transitions, and conditions. No manual configuration.

**3. Deploy triggers with one click.** Skene Cloud generates PL/pgSQL trigger functions on your Skene Skills tables and deploys them to your Supabase project. When a row changes, the trigger writes to `skene_growth.event_log`, which forwards to Skene Cloud via `pg_net`.

**4. The journey engine processes events in real-time.** Every INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on your tables can trigger automated actions: emails, webhooks, analytics events, state transitions. Deterministic condition gates with an optional AI semantic layer for edge cases.

### What you get

#### Customer journey automation
Build journeys across your entire schema. A contact moves from lead to prospect to customer. A deal moves through pipeline stages. A ticket escalates through SLA tiers. Skene Cloud tracks every entity's journey and triggers actions at each transition.

#### Pipeline lifecycle builder
The same journey builder that tracks product onboarding works for sales pipelines, support queues, hiring funnels, and subscription lifecycles. Every Skene Skills enum is a lifecycle waiting to be visualized and automated.

| Lifecycle | Source | Stages |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Contact | `contact_type` enum | lead > prospect > customer > partner |
| Deal | `pipeline_stages` table | Lead > Qualified > Proposal > Negotiation > Closed Won |
| Ticket | `ticket_status` enum | open > pending > resolved > closed |
| Task | `task_status` enum | todo > in_progress > in_review > done |
| Subscription | `subscription_status` enum | trialing > active > past_due > canceled |
| Invoice | `invoice_status` enum | draft > open > paid > void |
| Document | `document_status` enum | draft > published > archived |

#### Cross-entity orchestration
The real power is connecting lifecycles across entities:

- **Lead-to-Revenue**: Contact created > first deal > deal won > subscription created > first payment
- **Support-driven retention**: Ticket spike > subscription at risk > proactive outreach > saved or churned
- **Product-led growth**: User signup > feature adoption > team invite > upgrade > expansion deal

#### Built-in actions
When a lifecycle transition fires, Skene Cloud can:

- Send emails via Resend (AI-generated or template-based)
- POST to any webhook with variable interpolation
- Fire analytics events for your data warehouse
- Create follow-up tasks or tickets in your Skene Skills tables
- Trigger custom actions via the tool registry

### When you're ready

1. Install Skene Skills into your Supabase project
2. Sign up at [skene.ai](https://skene.ai) and connect your Supabase project
3. The AI compiler generates lifecycles and suggests automations -- activate the ones you want

Your schema stays in your database. Skene Cloud reads events, processes journeys, and dispatches actions. Disconnect at any time and keep everything. Skene Skills has zero dependencies on Skene Cloud.

## How installation works

### What's in each Skill

```
crm/
├── SKILL.md          # Schema docs, example queries, dependencies
├── migration.sql     # Tables, enums, indexes, RLS policies
├── seed.sql          # Realistic demo data
└── manifest.json     # Metadata and dependency declarations
```

### Via skills.sh (recommended)

```bash
# Install all skills -- lands in .claude/skills/
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene

# Install specific skills
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene -s crm
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene -s billing

# Install globally (available in all projects)
npx skills add SkeneTechnologies/skene -g
```

Your AI agent reads the SKILL.md files for context, then applies the `migration.sql` to your Supabase project. Dependencies are declared in each skill's manifest.

### Direct SQL (no agent needed)

```bash
# Set your Supabase database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@db.yourproject.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Install skills in dependency order
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f identity/migration.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f crm/migration.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f pipeline/migration.sql

# Optional: load seed data
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f identity/seed.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f crm/seed.sql
```

Migrations are additive -- they create new tables and enums in the `public` schema without touching existing tables.

### Verify

```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename NOT LIKE 'pg_%';

-- List all enums
SELECT t.typname, e.enumlabel
FROM pg_type t
JOIN pg_enum e ON t.oid = e.enumtypid
ORDER BY t.typname, e.enumsortorder;
```

### Wire up Supabase Auth

The `users` table links to Supabase Auth via `auth_id`. Add this trigger to auto-create a user row on signup:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (auth_id, email, full_name, org_id)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    coalesce(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.email),
    coalesce(
      (NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'org_id')::uuid,
      (SELECT id FROM public.organizations LIMIT 1)
    )
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

## Why not Salesforce/HubSpot?

| | Salesforce/HubSpot | Skene Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Data ownership** | Their servers, their rules, their API limits | Your Supabase project, your Postgres, your data |
| **AI/ML access** | Restricted. Salesforce prohibits using Slack data for LLM training. Meta blocks third-party AI on WhatsApp Business data | Full access. Train models, build features, pipe into any tool |
| **Terms stability** | Can change terms to restrict AI use, export, or integrations at any time | MIT licensed. Terms never change |
| **Pricing** | Per-seat. $25-300/user/month | Supabase pricing. $25/month for most projects |
| **Customization** | Point-and-click config, proprietary scripting | Raw SQL. Extend with Edge Functions, Realtime, Storage |
| **Vendor lock-in** | Years of migration work to leave | `pg_dump` and you're done |
| **Schema access** | Abstracted behind proprietary ORM | Direct Postgres. Every tool in the ecosystem works |
| **Open source** | No | Yes. MIT licensed. Fork it, modify it, ship it |

## FAQ

**What are Skills?**
Skills are composable backend capabilities that follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Each skill is a self-contained set of tables, enums, RLS policies, and seed data packaged with a SKILL.md that any AI agent can read. Install via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) or apply the SQL directly.

**Do I need a CLI?**
No. Skills don't require any CLI tool. Install via `npx skills add` (the skills.sh standard), or run the `migration.sql` files directly with `psql`. No build step, no package manager, no runtime.

**Can I install just one skill?**
Yes. Only `identity` is required as a base. Everything else is optional. Dependencies are declared in each skill's `manifest.json`.

**Why not EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value)?**
Real typed tables for the 80% case. JSONB `metadata` column plus `custom_field_definitions` / `custom_field_values` for the 20%. Query performance and type safety where it matters, flexibility where you need it.

**What about the UI?**
Skene Skills is the backend. Pair with any frontend framework, admin panel builder, or let an AI coding agent build the UI. The tables are designed to be straightforward to query from any client.

**Does this work without Skene Cloud?**
Yes, 100% standalone. No dependencies on Skene services. Skene Cloud adds automation and journey tracking, but Skene Skills is a complete backend on its own.

**Can I modify a skill after installing?**
Yes. It's just SQL in your Supabase project. No ORM, no code generation, no lock-in.

**Does this work without Supabase?**
The SQL is standard PostgreSQL. RLS policies and `auth.uid()` are Supabase-specific, but you can replace `auth.uid()` with your own auth layer.
