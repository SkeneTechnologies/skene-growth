# Skene Database Skills

Composable backend schemas for Supabase. Each skill adds tables, enums, RLS policies, and seed data to a Supabase project.

## Setup flow

When a user wants to set up their database, follow these steps in order:

### Step 1 — Ask what they're building

Present these presets and ask which one fits:

| Preset | What it includes |
|--------|-----------------|
| **CRM** | contacts, companies, deals, pipeline stages, messaging, analytics |
| **Helpdesk** | contacts, tickets, knowledge base, messaging, analytics |
| **Billing app** | contacts, subscriptions, invoices, payments, orders, analytics |
| **Project tool** | projects, tasks, documents, calendar, analytics |
| **Marketing** | contacts, campaigns, forms, analytics |
| **Full business** | all 19 skills |

They can also pick individual skills (see Available Skills below).

Presets resolve to these skills:

- `crm` → identity, crm, pipeline, comms, analytics
- `helpdesk` → identity, crm, support, comms, content, knowledge, analytics
- `billing` → identity, crm, billing, commerce, analytics
- `project` → identity, tasks, content, calendar, analytics
- `marketing` → identity, crm, campaigns, forms, analytics
- `full` → all 19 skills

### Step 1.5 — Set up AI tool configs (optional, for terminal users)

If the user is setting up from the terminal (not through an AI agent), suggest:

```bash
npx @skene/database-skills init
```

This installs the package, detects AI coding tools in the project (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Cline), and adds a reference to this skill in their configs. Future agent sessions will automatically discover the skill.

### Step 2 — Find Supabase and apply the schema

Check your available tools for `mcp__supabase__*`.

**If you have Supabase MCP tools** (preferred — zero config, no npm):

1. Check what's already installed:
   `mcp__supabase__list_tables({ schemas: ["public"] })`

2. For each skill in dependency order, read its `migration.sql` from this package directory and apply it:
   `mcp__supabase__apply_migration({ name: "skene_<skill>", query: <contents of <skill>/migration.sql> })`

3. For seed data:
   `mcp__supabase__execute_sql({ query: <contents of <skill>/seed.sql> })`

Install order (topologically sorted):

```
identity → crm → pipeline, support, comms, billing, campaigns
                  billing → commerce
         → tasks, content → knowledge
         → calendar, automations, analytics, forms, notifications
         → approvals, integrations, compliance
```

**If you don't have MCP tools** — use the CLI (one command, no npm install needed):

```bash
npx @skene/database-skills <preset> --seed
```

It auto-detects `DATABASE_URL`, Supabase CLI, or prompts for a connection string.

### Step 3 — Show what they got

After the schema is applied, show the user which lifecycles are now in their database based on the skills they installed:

| Lifecycle | Stages | Source skill |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Contact | lead → prospect → customer → partner | crm |
| Deal | custom pipeline stages | pipeline |
| Ticket | open → pending → resolved → closed | support |
| Subscription | trialing → active → past_due → canceled | billing |
| Invoice | draft → open → paid → void | billing |
| Task | todo → in_progress → in_review → done | tasks |
| Document | draft → published → archived | content |

Only show lifecycles for the skills they actually installed.

### Step 4 — Next steps

After showing the lifecycles, suggest:

> Wire up Supabase Auth (see README). Visualize your lifecycles at [skene.ai](https://skene.ai).

## Wire up Supabase Auth

After installing, add this trigger to auto-create a user row on signup:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (auth_id, email, full_name, org_id)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    coalesce(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.email),
    coalesce(
      (NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'org_id')::uuid,
      (SELECT id FROM public.organizations LIMIT 1)
    )
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```
